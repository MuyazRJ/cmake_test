Briefly (in around 200 words) describe your roles and responsibilities during your placement. What projects did you work on? What were the main technologies that you used?
1.	I have worked on several key projects, primarily focused on software development. One of my main responsibilities involved working on a project that previously used MakeFiles but was messy and difficult to maintain. I took the initiative to convert the project to use CMake, which helped streamline the build and deployment process. I also set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines with GitLab, integrating pytest for running tests and CTest for test automation.
Additionally, I worked on a project aimed at converting Python simulation codes to C++ to improve execution speed. The goal was to make the simulations run faster by leveraging the performance benefits of C++. I successfully converted the Python files to C++ while applying good C++ practices, including object-oriented programming (OOP), memory management, and optimising performance. This significantly improved the efficiency of the simulations.
Overall, I worked extensively with CMake, Python, C++, and GitLab CI tools, gaining hands-on experience with debugging, version control, and automation. This experience allowed me to improve my programming skills and ability to manage complex workflows while solving technical challenges.
Are there any projects you are particularly proud of or new skills learnt. Again, no more than 200 words
2.	I am particularly proud of my work on converting a project from MakeFiles to CMake. This was a challenging task because the original build system was messy and difficult to maintain. Despite these challenges, I successfully restored the software to a working state and went beyond expectations by completing additional tasks before the December deadline. Throughout this process, I maintained an effective network of contacts, making sure I had the necessary support to overcome obstacles. This experience not only improved the project's structure but also strengthened my ability to manage deadlines and collaborate effectively with others.

Even Better If (EBI) What areas have you and your manager identified for improvement in the future?
3.	Since my background is in computer science and I was originally hired as a data scientist, I feel that one area for improvement would be expanding the range of projects and tasks I get involved in across the business. While I've gained a lot of software engineering experience, I think branching out into different areas would help me grow and develop new skills. It would also give me a better understanding of how different teams work and how the business operates as a whole, allowing me to contribute more effectively in the future
