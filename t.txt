When you're using a module system on Unix (such as module command to load different versions of Python), and you find that PYTHONPATH works with Python 3.8 but not with Python 3.6.4, there are a few things to consider that might be causing this behavior. This is typically related to how the module environment is set up or how the Python interpreter handles PYTHONPATH.

Steps to Troubleshoot
Check the Environment Variables After Loading the Module After you load Python 3.6.4 with the module command, verify whether PYTHONPATH is still set correctly. You can do this by running:

bash
Copy code
echo $PYTHONPATH
Ensure that it is correctly pointing to the expected directories. If it is not set, the issue might be related to how the module system is configured.

Compare Environment Before and After Module Load You can compare the environment variables before and after loading the module. Here's a quick way to do it:

bash
Copy code
env > env_before.txt
module load python/3.6.4
env > env_after.txt
diff env_before.txt env_after.txt
This will help you identify any changes that happen when you load the module.

Check Module File Configuration The module system on Unix typically modifies environment variables when loading a module. The configuration for the Python 3.6.4 module might be resetting or overriding the PYTHONPATH. You can inspect the module file for Python 3.6.4 to see if it has any directives that modify PYTHONPATH.

The module files are usually located in a directory like /usr/share/modules/modulefiles/ or /etc/modulefiles/. You can check the contents of the Python 3.6.4 module file by running:

bash
Copy code
module show python/3.6.4
Look for any lines that modify PYTHONPATH. If there are, it might be the reason your PYTHONPATH is not being preserved.

Manually Set PYTHONPATH After Loading the Module If the module system is indeed modifying or resetting PYTHONPATH, you can try manually setting it after loading the module:

bash
Copy code
module load python/3.6.4
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/project_root:$PYTHONPATH
Then, run your Python script and check if sys.path includes your PYTHONPATH directories.

Check for Differences in Python Startup Behavior Different versions of Python may handle startup configurations slightly differently. Python can read configuration from various locations (e.g., sitecustomize.py, .pth files). There could be differences in the environment setup for Python 3.6.4 that are affecting PYTHONPATH.

You can inspect the startup behavior of Python by running:

bash
Copy code
python3.6 -v
This will give you verbose output about what Python is doing when it starts up, including what directories are being added to sys.path.

Use sitecustomize.py for Python 3.6.4 If you can't resolve the issue via the module system, you can use sitecustomize.py to manually ensure that PYTHONPATH is included in sys.path for Python 3.6.4.

Create a sitecustomize.py file in your Python installation's site-packages directory with the following content:

python
Copy code
import sys
import os

pythonpath = os.getenv('PYTHONPATH')
if pythonpath:
    sys.path.extend(pythonpath.split(os.pathsep))
This will manually add the directories in PYTHONPATH to sys.path when Python starts.

Conclusion
The key to resolving this issue is understanding how the module system is modifying the environment and ensuring that PYTHONPATH is correctly preserved or set after loading the module. By inspecting the environment and the module configuration, and potentially using workarounds like sitecustomize.py, you should be able to make PYTHONPATH work with Python 3.6.4.

If the problem persists, you might also want to consult with the system administrator who manages the module system, as they may need to adjust the configuration for Python 3.6.4.

The error message indicating that "no file or directory exists Lib.mkl.core.1" suggests that your program is trying to load the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), but the required shared library or dependencies are not available.

This typically occurs when the required MKL libraries are not in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or the environment is not correctly set up to locate them. MKL is often used for numerical computations, and it is a common dependency for libraries like NumPy, SciPy, or other performance-oriented Python packages.

Hereâ€™s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:
# Check if GCC is available by looking for a common GCC environment variable
find_program(GCC_FOUND gcc)

# Check if Intel compiler is available
find_program(INTEL_FOUND icc)

if (NOT GCC_FOUND AND NOT INTEL_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "No suitable compiler found. Please load a compiler module (e.g., module load gcc or module load intel).")
endif()

1. Check if MKL is Installed
If you are using a distribution like Anaconda or Intel Python, MKL is often included. To check if MKL is installed, you can search for the MKL package:

For Anaconda:

bash
Copy code
conda list mkl
For pip:

bash
Copy code
pip show mkl
If MKL is not installed, you may need to install it using:

For Anaconda:

bash
Copy code
conda install mkl
For pip (usually via intel-numpy or similar packages):

bash
Copy code
pip install mkl
2. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Ensure that the MKL libraries are included in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This environment variable tells the dynamic linker where to look for shared libraries (.so files).

Find the MKL library path: You can usually find MKL libraries in a directory like /opt/intel/mkl/lib or within your Anaconda environment.

For an Anaconda environment:
bash
Copy code
conda info --envs  # Identify your active environment
find $CONDA_PREFIX -name 'libmkl_core.so*'  # Locate the MKL libraries
Add MKL to LD_LIBRARY_PATH: Once you have identified the directory containing libmkl_core.so, you can add it to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

bash
Copy code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/mkl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
For example, if you are using Anaconda, it might be something like:

bash
Copy code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
3. Use the Correct Environment
If you are using a virtual environment or a conda environment, make sure that you have activated the correct environment before running your Cython code. Activating the environment should set up the paths correctly:

For Conda:

bash
Copy code
conda activate your_environment_name
For Virtualenv:

bash
Copy code
source your_virtualenv/bin/activate
This ensures that the environment is correctly configured, including paths to MKL libraries.

4. Rebuild the Cython Extension with Correct Linker Options
If you are compiling the Cython extension yourself, ensure that it is correctly linked against the MKL libraries. You may need to provide the correct linker flags:

Specify MKL libraries: If you are building with GCC, you can link against MKL by providing the necessary flags. For example:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o your_extension.so your_extension.c -lmkl_rt -L/path/to/mkl/lib -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/mkl/lib
Use numpy.distutils: If you are using setup.py to build your Cython extension and you rely on NumPy, you can use numpy.distutils to manage the linking:

python
Copy code
from numpy.distutils.core import setup, Extension

ext = Extension('your_extension',
                sources=['your_extension.c'],
                libraries=['mkl_rt'],
                library_dirs=['/path/to/mkl/lib'],
                runtime_library_dirs=['/path/to/mkl/lib'])

setup(ext_modules=[ext])


from setuptools import setup, Extension
from Cython.Build import cythonize
import numpy

# Define the path to MKL libraries
mkl_libs = ['/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64']
mkl_libs_flags = ['-lmkl_rt']  # Link against the MKL runtime library

# Define the extension module
ext_modules = [
    Extension(
        'my_module',
        sources=['my_module.pyx'],
        include_dirs=[numpy.get_include(), '/opt/intel/mkl/include'],
        library_dirs=mkl_libs,
        libraries=['mkl_rt'],
        extra_compile_args=['-O3'],
        extra_link_args=mkl_libs_flags
    )
]
