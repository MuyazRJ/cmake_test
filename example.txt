The install() command in CMake is used within the CMakeLists.txt file to specify how and where to install the build products, such as executables, libraries, headers, and other resources. This command helps define installation rules for your project.

Basic Syntax
Here's the basic syntax for the install() command:

cmake
Copy code
install(TARGETS target1 target2 ...
        [EXPORT <export-name>]
        [RUNTIME DESTINATION <dir>]
        [LIBRARY DESTINATION <dir>]
        [ARCHIVE DESTINATION <dir>]
        [INCLUDES DESTINATION <dir>]
        [PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION <dir>]
        [PRIVATE_HEADER DESTINATION <dir>])
        
install(FILES file1 file2 ...
        DESTINATION <dir> 
        [PERMISSIONS permissions]
        [CONFIGURATIONS config1 config2 ...]
        [COMPONENT component]
        [RENAME <name>])
        
install(DIRECTORY source_dir1 source_dir2 ...
        DESTINATION <dir> 
        [FILES_MATCHING [PATTERN <pattern>]]
        [PERMISSIONS permissions]
        [CONFIGURATIONS config1 config2 ...]
        [COMPONENT component]
        [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
Installing Targets
To install a target (like an executable or a library), use the install(TARGETS ...) command:

cmake
Copy code
# Install an executable or library
install(TARGETS my_executable my_library
        RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
        ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
RUNTIME DESTINATION is used for executables.
LIBRARY DESTINATION is used for shared libraries.
ARCHIVE DESTINATION is used for static libraries.
Installing Files
To install specific files (like headers or configuration files), use the install(FILES ...) command:

cmake
Copy code
# Install header files
install(FILES my_header1.h my_header2.h
        DESTINATION include/my_project)
Installing Directories
To install a whole directory and its contents, use the install(DIRECTORY ...) command:

cmake
Copy code
# Install a directory of headers
install(DIRECTORY include/
        DESTINATION include/my_project
        FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")
